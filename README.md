# 2020

2020 is a data visualization app that gives users access to public sentiment (via Twitter API) about an upcoming 2020 presidential candidate

## Background and Overview

Public figures and policy are hardly the most talked about issues in everyday conversation, yet they potentially have the most impact in our lives. Part of the problem is the overwhelming amount of information that is thrown at us on a daily basis. 

2020 will simplify this intake by giving you a quick snap shot of peoples' attitudes towards a certain candidate and the popularity of his/her stance on certain issues (i.e., the economy, social issues, etc). The hope is for the average user to quickly see why people are pleased/displeased with a candidate and to begin conversation so that voters become more informed.

## Functionality & MVP
* User authorization: signup and login
* Executve API calls and data fetching from Twitter and PreCeive (a sentiment analysis processor)
* Parse data from API responses and display data onto application
* Implement a comments section to provide users with interactive experience
